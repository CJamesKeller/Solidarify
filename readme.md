# Solidarify

## Description

A social network for local organizations to promote collaboration.
Users may search for organizations or events they are familiar with, and discover others they may be interested in based on previous collaboration between those organizations.

## Motivation

For decades, the decline of local civic organizations has been a cause for concern among a wide spectrum of people. Technology often facilitates habits that lead to this decline in collaboration with our neighbors. To counter this trend, Solidarify leverages the strengths of digital communication to facilitate use of the human strength of working together and standing together -- in solidarity.

## Usage

Organizations may request access, which the Admin is able to grant via email.

Once granted access, the organizations then create a profile, and can begin to add events.

These events can include collaborators from among the organizations that have created profiles on the site. Once listed as potential collaborators, the organizations chosen are sent an email to confirm or reject being listed as collaborators on the event.

These events and organizations are searchable via a force-directed graph, where connection strength is proportionate to the amount of collaboration that has occurred between each of the organizations.

This intuitive display allows for a fun and convenient experience in getting to know the community better, allowing users to become more engaged.
